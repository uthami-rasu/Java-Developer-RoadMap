Got it 👍 You want the **most important operators in Java** (not just arithmetic).
Here’s a **complete and categorized list** with the most commonly used ones:

---

## 🔑 **1. Arithmetic Operators**

Used for math operations.

* `+` (Addition)
* `-` (Subtraction)
* `*` (Multiplication)
* `/` (Division)
* `%` (Modulus)
* `++` (Increment)
* `--` (Decrement)

---

## 🔑 **2. Relational (Comparison) Operators**

Used to compare two values (result is `true` or `false`).

* `==` (Equal to)
* `!=` (Not equal to)
* `>` (Greater than)
* `<` (Less than)
* `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
* `<=` (Less than or equal to)

---

## 🔑 **3. Logical Operators**

Used for combining conditions.

* `&&` (Logical AND)
* `||` (Logical OR)
* `!` (Logical NOT)

---

## 🔑 **4. Assignment Operators**

Used to assign values to variables.

* `=` (Assign)
* `+=` (Add and assign)
* `-=` (Subtract and assign)
* `*=` (Multiply and assign)
* `/=` (Divide and assign)
* `%=` (Modulus and assign)

---

## 🔑 **5. Bitwise Operators**

Operate on bits (used in low-level programming).

* `&` (Bitwise AND)
* `|` (Bitwise OR)
* `^` (Bitwise XOR)
* `~` (Bitwise complement)
* `<<` (Left shift)
* `>>` (Right shift)
* `>>>` (Unsigned right shift)

---

## 🔑 **6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator**

Shortcut for `if-else`.

```java
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
```

---

## 🔑 **7. Type Cast Operator**

Used to convert one type into another.

```java
double d = 10.5;
int i = (int) d; // Explicit casting
```

---

## 🔑 **8. Instanceof Operator**

Checks whether an object is of a particular class.

```java
if(obj instanceof String) { ... }
```

---

## 🔑 **9. New Operator**

Used to create objects.

```java
String s = new String("Hello");
```

---

✅ **Summary – Most Important for Interviews & Coding**

* **Arithmetic**: `+ - * / % ++ --`
* **Relational**: `== != > < >= <=`
* **Logical**: `&& || !`
* **Assignment**: `= += -= *= /= %=`
* **Conditional (?:)**
* **instanceof**
